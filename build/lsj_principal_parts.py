"""Parse principal parts (fut., aor., pf., etc.) out of LSJ head text.

The LSJ entry for a verb starts with a header sentence that lists the
canonical principal parts before the English definition begins, e.g.:

    λύω, fut. λύσω, aor. ἔλυσα, pf. λέλυκα,
    pf. m./p. λέλυμαι, aor. p. ἐλύθην

This module turns that header into a structured dict like::

    {"fut": "λύσω", "aor": "ἔλυσα", "pf": "λέλυκα",
     "pf_mp": "λέλυμαι", "aor_p": "ἐλύθην"}

It is intentionally conservative: a missing or ambiguous principal part
yields no entry rather than a guess. Downstream code can fall back to
present-only expansion when the parser returns nothing.

The parser handles:
  - Leading prosody bracket (``[ᾰ]``, ``[α]``)
  - Bold/wikitext-style headword echo (``**βάλλω** βάλλω,``)
  - Section markers ``:—Med.``, ``:—Pass.``, ``Med. and Pass.``
  - Dual aorist labels (``aor. 1``, ``aor. 2``)
  - Author-attribution citation suffixes after each form

What it deliberately does NOT do:
  - Resolve cross-reference verbs (``v. καταχέω``)
  - Expand suffix-only abbreviations (``fut. -ψω``) - those would need
    to know which letters of the headword to drop, which is itself a
    morphological judgement; we leave that to downstream Lua expansion
    when a full form is given instead.
  - Pick variant forms; the first attestation wins.
